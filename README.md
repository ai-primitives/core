# AI Primitives

## Abstractions

- [ ] [ai-database](./packages/ai-database) - DB abstraction with hybrid vector search for synthetic data, AI tool-calling and RAG applications
- [ ] [ai-functions](./packages/ai-functions) - Rapidly develop, evaluate, and iterate on prompts & models with strongly-typed structured outputs
- [ ] [ai-workflows](./packages/ai-workflows) - Compose AI and code-based functions into workflows with durable execution and multi-variant eval testing
- [ ] [agentic.md](./packages/agentic.md) - Rapidly develop, evaluate, experiment, and iterate on AI Agents and agentic workflows using Markdown/MDX

## Platform

- [ ] [database.do](./packages/database.do) - AI-native Database as a service for AI tool-calling and RAG applications via CLI, API, and Editor UI
- [ ] [functions.do](./packages/functions.do) - Rapidly iterate, evaluate, and experiment with prompts & models while maintaining strongly-typed API
- [ ] [workflows.do](./packages/workflows.do) - Compose AI and code-based functions into workflows with durable execution and multi-variant eval testing
- [ ] [agents.do](./packages/agents.do) - Create, deploy, observe, experiment, monitor, and manage autonomous AI Agents via CLI, API, and Editor UI

## Utilities

- [ ] [ai-props](./packages/ai-props) - use AI object generation to wrap any React component, transforming any input into consistent strongly-typed props
- [ ] [db.mdx](./packages/db.mdx) - leverage MDX to unify structured data, unstructured content, and code execution into a local or remote files
- [ ] [mdx.do](./packages/mdx.do) - MDX-as-a-service with API, CLI, and editor UI to create and manage structured data, unstructured content, and code
- [ ] [ai.mdx](./packages/ai.mdx) - use local or remote MDX files as a way to manage your AI Database, AI Functions, AI Workflows, and AI Agents
- [ ] [workers.mdx](./packages/workers.mdx) - simplify Cloudflare Workers & Workers for Platforms development with MDX for config, code, and JSX rendering
- [ ] [workers.do](./packages/workers.do) - MDX-based Platform with API, CLI, and UI to develop and deploy APIs/Apps on Cloudflare Workers for Platforms
- [ ] [payload.mdx](./packages/payload.mdx) - Rapidly create Payload applications using MDX for configuration, code, and custom UI components
- [ ] [payload.do](./packages/payload.do) - MDX-based Platform with API, CLI, and UI to develop and deploy headless CMSs and web apps with Payload
